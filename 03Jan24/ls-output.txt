#This is a little not easy 
#Takena break to eat and regaIN FLOW
#WHEN TIRED, REST, NOT QUIT. I am back 6 hours later for 30 more minutes. tomorrow we do 2 hours to account for 2nd jan coding session
#So, where were we....
#The Story #
# Our target clients will include peole of all ages, from chilfren age 3 all the way to p[ensioners in their 60s 
#The algorithm is required to use data to recommend which types of targets should target which type of client in whcih mode/form 
#We will first sort the clients into types based on broad demographic data that is publicly available and custom fed into the model 
#The data available seems to show a correlation between age of person and form of media consumed,so we will use them as the primary factors 
#The method 
#Create a line graph with Client type population vs type of media consumed 
#Type of medias include internet search engine, social media, tv, radio , newspaper, blogs, billboards and outdoor signs
#Draw a line of regression between the x and y axes.

#Match points in x with points in  y using coresponding line matches via the line of regression(for clack of better words, will have a second look at this, or will I? maybe not...but we will sea about like moses and the israelis on their way to steal promised land a couipe of thousand years before modern day...just swap modern day US with the mighty God and you basically have the same scenario. W e are raiding because our godfather said he will, and did tie our opponents hands to let us fight to victory in an unfair competionn for resouces and plunder. But we wont talk about that, thisis just after all just coding. #Freee the palestininians 
#Back to work
#Match points in x axis with points in y axis via line of regression(thats it, came back to it) 
#Save the data 
#Print out the %tage of which demographic consumes which type media.
#Use percentage points to be calibrated by operator to determine what percentage of ads in which media will target which demographic.
#It will be dependent on individual operators to design the type of ads for each of the demographics depending on budget and priority of the user organisations
#Now, Loooks like we are almost done, kudos lucky. 
#Swiftly move on to recording a sample podcast with or without mic 
#Well, we still have 3 minutes on the clock so lets steel the time and use the two arms as a medieval glock to slay the dragons we face on the daily like the samurai jack we is on the inside even as we...rhyme ran outtah scheme outtah steam for the stream down to sea what you see when you seed....Stay Scheming
