Partner's Name: Lucky Nyabicha Date: June 22, 2023 Time: 8 AM GMT Lucky Nyabicha and I have had a fruitful discussion about the significance of cultivating a GroWtH mindset, particularly when faced with challenging tasks on our journey towards achieving our goals. There were no areas of confusion or disagreement.
